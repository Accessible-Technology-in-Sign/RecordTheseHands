  """Get the login hash.

  The "login hash" is the username a colon and then sha256 hash of the
  "login token" in hex.  The login token is itself the username a colon
  and a sha256 hash.  The login token is generated iteratively from
  hashing the username a colon and the password/hash 1000 times which
  is performed on the client side.  This means the server never sees
  the user's password, nevertheless, this login token is not stored,
  but one more iteration is performed, creating the "login hash" (1001
  iterations total) and that value is stored.

  In short, the following code produces the login_hash from the password.
  val = f'{username}:{password}'
  for i in range(1001):
    val = get_login_hash(username, val)

  Args:
    username: string username of the annotator.
    login_token: string login token in the format username, colon, sha256 hash.

  Returns:
    The login hash, a string of username, colon, and a sha256 hash of the
    login token.
