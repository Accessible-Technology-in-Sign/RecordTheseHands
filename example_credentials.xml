<!-- Copy this file to app/src/main/res/values/credentials.xml and make
     modifications as appropriate.  If the field backend_server is not
     present then no server communication will be made.
     If confirmation_email_sender is not present, then no session notification
     emails will be sent.   I believe confirmation_email_sender must be a
     gmail account.
     Please do not use an account or password that you care about in
     this section, anyone with access to the apk will very easily
     have access to the account name and password.
     Under no circumstances should the file be committed to github or
